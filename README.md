# My SETI Challenge Response

The SETI Institute hosted an online code challenge in 2017. The goal was for citizen scientists to find a signal classification algorithm for use in the mission to find extra terrestrial radio communication. The radio signal data is to be represented as a spectrogram so that the problem can be converted into an image classification problem. The aim is to build machine learning and deep learning techniques to construct highly accurate classification systems that very successfully classified the signals in our simulated data set.

Here I present my response to the challenge. I use deep learning from the TensorFlow package in Python to classify the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) radio data.
